ESLint couldn't find a configuration file. To set up a configuration file for this project, please run:

    npm init @eslint/config

ESLint looked for configuration files in /Users/nemanja/Workspace/a/handler/apps/server/src/__tests__ and its ancestors. If it found none, it then looked in your home directory.

If you think you already have a configuration file or if you need more help, please stop by the ESLint Discord server: https://eslint.org/chat
