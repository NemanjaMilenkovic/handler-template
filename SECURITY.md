# Security Policy

The team behind this template takes security very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge and address them.

## Supported Versions

This is a template repository, not a published package with version numbers. Security patches and updates will only be applied to the latest version on the `main` branch.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `main`  | :white_check_mark: |

It is the responsibility of the users who have cloned or forked this template to merge these security updates into their own repositories.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

We encourage you to use **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. You can do this by clicking the "Report a vulnerability" button on the [Security tab](https://github.com/NemanjaMilenkovic/handler-template/security) of the repository.

This is the fastest and most secure way to reach us. Using this feature ensures the vulnerability is disclosed privately and allows us to coordinate a fix with you before public disclosure.

### What to Expect

- We will make a best effort to acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
- We will provide a more detailed response within **72 hours** after acknowledgement, indicating the next steps in handling your report.
- We will keep you informed of our progress as we investigate and, if necessary, work on a fix.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
