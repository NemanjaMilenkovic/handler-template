• Appears during `next build` / `next dev`.  
• Harmless – comes from Webpack code bundled by Next 15.  
• Tracked upstream: <https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/74460>  
• Disappears once we upgrade to the Next 16 release that removes Webpack 5’s
legacy helper.

_No action required for production deployments._
